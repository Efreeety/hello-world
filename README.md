## Who i am:
### I'm Nicolas Sandoval, a 28 years old chilean student of Civil Engineering in Extractive Metallurgy in the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso. I'm currently learning how to code by myself as a personal project for self improvement. My goal is to be able to combine the knowledge I adquire by learning code with my studies and to develop software solutions for the mining industry in my country.

## Hobbies:
### Beside of learning code, I like to play videogames in my free time. Also, I practiced archery for a while and I pretend to do it again in the future. I also like to hanging out with my friends and playing with my pets.
